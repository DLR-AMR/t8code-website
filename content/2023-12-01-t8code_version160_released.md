After three months of coding there is a new release of t8code available! Version 1.6.0 is more concerned about software maintenance than new features, but we also sneaked in some performance upgrades!

The most important changes are:

- Bug-fixes, who des not love 'em?

- Sweet sweet performance upgrades in geometry module

- New depth-first-search

- Resolved many long overdue to-dos
