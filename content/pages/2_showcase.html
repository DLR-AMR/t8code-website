									Something about data reduction
								</h2>
								<p>Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen.</p>
                                <p>We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. That easy. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow.</p>
                                <p>This is truly an almighty mountain. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. Anyone can paint.</p>

									Optimizing geometrical accuracy by curved mesh elements
								</h2>
								<p>Achieving a precise geometrical representation in numerical simulations typically involves refining mesh elements around curved areas of the geometry. However, this traditional method results in increased memory usage due to the greater number of elements involved.</p>
								<p>Utilizing polynomials to curve elements to the geometry is a common strategy for enhancing geometrical resolution. Yet, the accuracy of this approach hinges on the degree of the polynomial; insufficient degrees lead to subpar geometrical resolution, even with adaptive mesh refinement techniques.</p>
								<p>Our innovative approach involves enriching the initial mesh with the original geometrical data. By leveraging the parametric description of the geometry, we directly interpolate and curve each element to conform precisely to the geometry. Unlike polynomial-based methods, our approach ensures an exact representation of the geometry at every refinement level.</p>
								<p>The GIF is a demonstration of this geometry interpolation algorithm in action, showcasing curved tetrahedral mesh elements conforming to an airplane geometry while a refinement plane of level 2 moves along the aircraft's axis.</p>
								<p>In benchmark tests conducted on a workstation (768 GB RAM, 12 x 64 GB, DDR4, 2933 MHz) with 100 parallel processes, we achieved remarkable results. Without visualization output, our algorithm processed up to 5.6 billion tetrahedra, with load-balancing taking a mere 7 seconds thanks to the exceptional efficiency of our t8code technology.</p>

									Exceeding 1 Trillion mesh elements
								</h2>
								<p>To demonstrate the exceptional efficiency of t8code, we used the full JUWELS supercomputer (ca. 100k processes) to create and manage a massive mesh of 1.1 Trillion elements.
								In this examples we used a hybrid mesh of hexahedra, tetrahedra and prisms. Even with such large numbers, t8code only takes seconds to perform parallel mesh management tasks: Computing the Ghost layer was done in 1.4 seconds and load-balancing in 0.3.</p>

									Generating pictures using png2mesh
								</h2>
								<p>The png2mesh library can convert .png images into adaptive meshes. In order to do so, it uses the t8code library to build a mesh and refine it at the positions of dark pixels in the original image. You can choose between a quad mesh, triangle mesh, or a hybrid mesh containing both shapes. For more details see <a href="https://github.com/DLR-AMR/png2mesh" target="_blank"> the png2mesh github page.</a></p>
								<p> In this example our t8code logo was used to generate an adaptive mesh. On the left side, a hybrid mesh with a maximal level of 7 was used. On the right side, the logo was converted with a transparent background using a quad mesh. </p>

									Our submissions to the International Meshing Roundtable (IMR) 2022
								</h2>
								<p>
									The International Meshing Roundtable 2022 was held as part of the SIAM Conference on Parallel Processing for Scientific Computing 2022 (PP22). Following their call for entries to the meshing contest IMR, we constructed this mesh of the famous Seattle Space Needle. Our submission demonstrates the capability of t8code to manage very large hybrid meshes. 
								</p>
								<p>
									The mesh representing the Space Needle is embedded into a cubic mesh made out of all supported 3D mesh elements (hex, tets, prisms and pyramids). 
								</p>
								<p>
									Every element of the cubic mesh that intersects a line of the Space Needle mesh is refined - producing 81 million elements in 11.6 seconds on 56 cores.  The mesh also visualizes the huge difference in size that elements can have. On the coarsest level the elements have a diameter of up to 10m while the finest level divides the elements into elements that are 2cm small. 
								</p>

                  Collaboration with Trixi.jl - a numerical simulation framework for hyperbolic conservation laws written in Julia
								</h2>

                <p> <a href="https://trixi-framework.github.io/Trixi.jl"
                  target="_blank">Trixi.jl</a> is a numerical simulation framework for a
                  huge variety of hyperbolic conservation laws and is written in <a
                  href="https://julialang.org" target="_blank"> Julia </a>.  Key objective is to
                  pave the way for dynamical-adaptive, hybrid, curvilinear meshes in Trixi.jl by
                  interfacing with t8code. Scalable management of hybrid meshes - the combination of
                  different element types (triangles, quadrilaterals, tetraeders, hexaeders,
                  pyramids, etc.) into one single datastructure - is a unique feature of t8code,
                  which is not provided by other meshing libraries. Hybrid meshes allow for a
                  flexible and robust high-order approximation of complex geometries typically
                  found in many engineering applications. The project is still work-in-progress.

									Something about Juwels
								</h2>
								<p>If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. There it is. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there.</p>
                                <p>Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it.</p>
                                <p>I like to beat the brush. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul.</p>
