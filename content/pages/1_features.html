		Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Look at them little rascals. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. TEST

									Something about our algorithms

								<p>
									Work that paint. Let's do that again. Let's have a happy little tree in here. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. We need dark in order to show light. And right there you got an almighty cloud. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. Let's have a little bit of fun today. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here.

										Enabling geometry-based h- and p-refinement
									</h2>
									<p>
										With version 1.0.0 we introduce curved cell geometries. With these geometries you are able to link features (edges and faces) of cells directly to <a href="https://www.opencascade.com/" target="_blank">OpenCASCADE Technology</a> geometries (curves and surfaces).
										As you can see on the right, the linkage enables t8code to refine the cells along the provided geometry and even points evaluated inside an element are located with respect to the provided geometry.
									</p>
									<p>
										Additionaly, you can use the mesh generator <a href="https://gmsh.info/" target="_blank">Gmsh</a>, to create parametric mesh files. If you load these mesh files along with the meshed geometry, the cells get automatically linked to the geometry. This results in optimal h- and p-refinement along the geometries.
									</p>
									<p>
										Take a look at our three publications for additional information.

								Something something NetCDF
							</h2>
							<p>
								See there, told you that would be easy. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. And maybe, maybe, maybe... Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. We'll put a happy little sky in here. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. This is unplanned it really just happens. Here we're limited by the time we have. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out.
