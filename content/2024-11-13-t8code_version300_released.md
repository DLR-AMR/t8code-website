We are excited to announce the release of t8code v3.0.0, a major new release of our open-source software for parallel adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). With this release we switch to the CMake build system for fast and portable builds. Additionally, we added some new features and performance improvements.

t8code can speed up your simulations and visualizations by 10x - 100x while scaling from notebooks to supercomputers. We support all standard element shapes and meshes with hundreds of billions of elements.
